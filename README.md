# FoodExpvsHappinnes
This simple data analytics tries to analyze if my  happiness has an affect on my food expense
I usually report my happiness and statisfaction at the end of the day, on a scale of 1 to 5.
I also records my expense. 
I found out that there is no correlation between my mood and food expense as mostly my mood will be down.
